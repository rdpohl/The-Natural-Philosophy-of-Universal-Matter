# The Natural Philosophy of Universal Matter
> An original hypothesis that defines Universal Matter. Found to be very small matter and, via a few defined processes, build the Universe that we see and explore. 

## Main hypothesis:
> The Natural Philosophy of Universal Matter. This, the main Paper, explores the processes that build our visible Universe. The Paper shows that a very few processes, such as

* Accumulation of Universal Matter
* Defines Two Rotational Compositions and Combines the Results of these two Compositions
* Defines a Third Type of Rotational Composition and Attaches it to the Previous Two Combinations

Completing the build of a hydrogen atom, the world, and the universe around us.

### Supplemental Papers:
> These Papers Extend the Main hypothesis. The suggested order of reading these Papers are:

* The Structure of the Elements (see below for details)
* On Particle Size (see below for details)
* On Particle Movement
* On Gravity
* On Light
* On Time

CmP_Animation.py: On-Light and the Main Hypothesis share a companion Python program that illustrates Complementary Particles.

### The Structure of Elements According the Philosophy
> In folder named "Structure-of-Elements"
  
### Coded Example On Particle Sizing and Mass
> In folder named "On-Particle-Size" and contains Python code for report build
