# The Natural Philosophy of Universal Matter
> An original hypothesis that defines Universal Matter which is very small matter and, via a few defined processes, build the Universe that we see and explore. 

## Main hypothesis:
> The Natural Philosophy of Universal Matter. This, the main Paper, explores the processes that build our visible Universe. The Paper shows that a very few processes -
* Accumulation
* Two Rotational Compositions
* Combining the results of these two Compositions
* Defining a third Rotational Composition
* Attaching this Composition to the previous two combined
* Completing the builds of a Hydrogen atom

### Supplemental Papers:
> These Papers extend the main hypothesis. The suggested order of reading these Papers are:
* The Structure of the Elements (see below for details)
* On Particle Sizes (see below for details)
* On Particle Movement
* On Gravity
* On Light
* On Time

### The Structure of Elements According the Philosophy
> In folder named "Structure-of-Elements"
  
### Coded Example On Particle Sizing and Mass
> In folder named "On-Particle-Size" and contains Python code for report build
