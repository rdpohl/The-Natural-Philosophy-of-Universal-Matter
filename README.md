* Accumulation of Universal Matter
* Defines Two Rotational Compositions and Combines the Results of these two Compositions
* Defines a Third Type of Rotational Composition and Attaches it to the Previous Two Combinations

> Completing the build of a hydrogen atom, the world, and the universe around us.
